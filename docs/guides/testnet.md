# Testnet

The testnet is a test environment for BNB Beacon Chain network, run by the BNB Beacon Chain development community, which is open to developers.

The validators on the testnet are from development team.

You can connect a node to the testnet by downloading the [node binary](https://github.com/binance-chain/node-binary/tree/master/fullnode/testnet/0.6.3-hotfix) to use this [configuration](https://github.com/binance-chain/node-binary/tree/master/fullnode/testnet/0.6.3-hotfix/config).

There is also a [web wallet](https://testnet.bnbchain.world/en/) that can directly interact with the DEX. testnet.

## What is the testnet good for?

- Create your test address and get your testnet funds.
- Develop applications and try tutorials on BNB Beacon Chain without the potential to lose your own assets.
- Test your applications against new versions of BNB Beacon Chain.
- Analyze blockchain data on a smaller, non-trivial data set compared to the public network.
